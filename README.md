#WikiGraph

WikiGraph is a small software intended to help students test and understand graphs and the algorithms applied in this data structure. It is still in development, so the code might not be optimized and cleaned and some functionalities are not working.

###Algorithms Implemented

      * Depth-First Search
      * Depth Limited Search
      * Breadth-First Search
      * Minimum Spanning Tree
             + Kruskal
             + Prim
      * Shortest Path
             + Dijkstra
             + Bellman-Ford
      * Transpose Graph
      * Topological Order

###Bugs

      * Time it takes to run an algorithm is always displayed as zero
