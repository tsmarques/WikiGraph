#WikiGraph

WikiGraph is a small software intended to help students test and understand graphs and the algorithms applied in this Data Structures.

###Algorithms Implemented

      * Depth-First Search
      * Depth Limited Search
      * Breadth-First Search
      * Minimum Spanning Tree
             + Kruskal
             + Prim
      * Shortest Path
             + Dijkstra
             + Bellman-Ford
      * Transpose Graph
      * Topological Order

###Bugs

      * Time it takes to run an algorithm is displayed as zero
